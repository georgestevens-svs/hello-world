# hello-world
Learning  1354 deleted original README.md  And added this one in Git.

Does Fetch get this?  Sync Pushes and Fetches.

Fetch gets remote changes but does not Merge them.  Merge applies changes from Fetch.
Pull Fetches then Merges changes from remote.

Here is a local change 1 to master.

Here is a change in the local edit-readme5 branch.  Locally I had to Sync, then Push to
get changes to server.  Sync is purely local commit in repo.

Another local change to this branch followed by a sync to commit it locally.

Another local change to this branch (edit, save, commit all), followed by a sync.

1430 Create local branch edit-readme6 then save, commit all, sync.

1440 The above edit is in master!  It never got edit-readme6 branch

1445  I have to select the branch I want the edits to apply to in the branches view.
