# hello-world
Learning.  I added this sentence in the readme-edits branch.
I added this sentence in the edit-readme2 branch, locally in VS 2017.

After the commit and pull request, but before the merge into master I add this line.

After the above commit, and push to remote in VS, I add another line in VS.

1328  After merge of edit-readme2 to master and delete of that branch, in VS I create edit-readme3 branch. And write this message.
Then in changes I see there is one change and write a commit message and commit all.
